* Quality of NAIP and Google imagery
** What percent of Madison imagery is covered in shadow?

|                  | NAIP        | Google        |
|------------------+-------------+---------------|
| Percent Shadowed | 7.7 (+/- 2) | 3.6 (+/- 1.3) |

#+BEGIN_NOTES
How might this affect our estimates of cover?

plus or minus is 95% CI

#+END_NOTES
** Human disagreement in classification

- Robi and I agreed 96.6% of time when classifying 610 points.
- Disagreement due to the difficulty of classifying 1m^2 pixels,
  especially mixed or border pixels.

** Comparing NAIP and Google Earth imagery over Madison, WI.

As classified by Erker, agreement is 91.5% (n = 610 points).

| Reasons for Disagreement bw NAIP and Google               | points | percent |
|-----------------------------------------------------------+--------+---------|
| change in time                                            |      6 |       1 |

| spatial misregistration (parallax)                        |     23 |     3.8 |

| water looks like impervious                               |      1 |      .2 |
| shrubs or coarse herbaceous vegetation causing confusion. |      1 |      .2 |
| soil looks like impervious                                |      2 |      .3 |

** NAIP and Google Earth might disagree 9% of time, but do their averaged estimates agree?
Do the errors cancel out? Pretty much.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Even though agreement at any one point is only expected to be 90%,
estimates of cover are within about 1.5%.

I was surprised that naip didn't overestimate tree cover.  I thought
because of paralax it would.

Think about how viewing a city from a
tall building can make the whole place look forested, but a satellite
image tells otherwise.

standard error for these estimates with 584 points is about 2% (sqrt(.35*.65/584))


|        |  NAIP | Google |
|--------+-------+--------|
| grass  | 0.358 |  0.360 |
| imperv | 0.370 |  0.354 |
| tree   | 0.272 |  0.286 |

|-----------------------+-------+--------------------|
| % tree cover estimate | 33.3% | 17.1%              |

* How to proceed with other cities
1) Make the classifier more general
2) Make specific classifiers for categories of images (e.g. times of
   day)
